While exploring [three.js](https://threejs.org) once more, I found a great way to express my love for 3D modeling and creativeness. 
Today, I tested the importation of models from external sites like [Blender](https://www.blender.org/), which I am very familiar with.
I'm using both CS50IDE and Blender to tinker since they go hand in hand. The main focus of today's work was loaders for models and more specifically, the GLTF loader.

With the help of Mr. Mueller after much frustration, we found out how to get it working by using [this video](https://youtu.be/F4q2cqj_Tdc).
As of now, I am currently in step 5 of the Engineering Design Process where I created a prototype. 
The general terraforming was made with meshes with an intention of low poly graphics. The models like mushrooms, windmills, and the house that were used were taken from a site that offers them for free.
Keeping in note that my Freedom Project is mainly on an entertainment space, I thought of what would be the most appealing.
I tend to have an aesthetic that is pastel, magical, yet simplistic with great detail. 
After having a general idea, I started putting it into practice with the help of [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=151&v=0lj643VmTsg&feature=emb_title.).
It taught me a lot of the concepts behind materials and just overall shaping when it comes to floating islands.

The documentation on the three.js site helped me so much in getting this done. The examples and documents I referenced for this project was:
<ul>
<li>https://threejs.org/docs/?q=l#examples/en/loaders/GLTFLoader</li>
<li>https://threejs.org/docs/?q=light#api/en/lights/shadows/SpotLightShadow</li>
<li>https://threejs.org/docs/?q=light#api/en/lights/SpotLight</li>
<li>https://threejs.org/examples/#webgl_lights_spotlight</li>
</ul>

The reason why these 4 sites were very important was because I was trying to relpicate what I saw in Blender:

I wanted that same effect, but realized three.js does not work the same way. Either way, it still looked very good so I was satisfied.gp
