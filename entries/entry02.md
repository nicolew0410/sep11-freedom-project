By now, I definitely decided that I want to do **three.js**. In the engineering design process, I'm pretty sure I'm at step 4 where I know what I want to do and all I would need to continue on, is to execute the project.

I definitely added onto previous skills like debugging and learning how to educate myself on my own.
With debugging, I tinkered with the [first testing of three.js](https://codepen.io/nicolew0410/pen/ExgVPLO?editors=1010). This was when I started to realize how complex things were and how meticulous I would need to be in organization. Sometimes I would have no closing tags and it would ruin the whole program which took forever to find.
It looked way differently from the way we code right now as I started to learn how to experiment with my code. Learning different parameters from [three.js's documents, ](https://threejs.org) not only did I see the basics but I tried to include complex ideas as well.

I used many youtube videos as well, including:

I'm actually pretty proud with what I came up with and realized that animations for the future of my project, would have to be very precise. I may even need to use blender or the help of my partner Amelia possibly using Babylon! This would be great for future collaboration.
