Today, I will be deciding on what Javascript tool I will use for the SEP11 Freedom Project. 
In the beginning, as soon as I heard that [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com) was a challenge and would be an asset if we wanted to pursue this field in the future, I wanted to do it. After giving it more attention, I found out I couldn't make a project creative enough for it.
I have explored many options but the two that I limited it down to was either [three.js](https://threejs.org) or [Babylon.](https://www.babylonjs.com)
I have actually done rendering before on Blender so I would guess Babylon wouldn't be a challenge. 


With three.js, not only does it let me explore something new, but aid in the creation of the project I aspire for.
After finally making my decision of three.js, I went to their website and explored all the games already made to get some ideas.
Most had a certain aethetic that was low poly or a monochrome theme which I thought suited my style as well.
Automatically, I wanted to create a virtual experience that lets a user or the audience go through something somewhat aesthetic but with a message to it.
This message would either have to be some kind of  existential or societal questioning that makes others reflect. I still have to decide.
